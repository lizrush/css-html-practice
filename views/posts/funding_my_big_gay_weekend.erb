<h2>funding my big gay weekend</h2>
<h3>or: using indiegogo to get to a conference</h3>

<p> Being the only lesbian student in Ada presents a range of challenges: from having to avert my eyes from other women in the class lest they get the idea that I am objectifying them to watching what I say about my time outside of Ada so I don't accidentally flaunt my lifestyle. I restrain  from engaging in the bonding that comes with complimenting another woman's style or clothing. I try not to offend anyone, straight or otherwise, by saying things like "I am a lesbian" because, as I'm told, "diversity is not a competition". I defend the platonic nature of my existence & become a one-woman panopticon of "no homo". I bite my tongue.</p>

<p>While I love Ada, I love my peers, and I love programming, this shit can take its toll. Then came along the first Lesbians Who Tech Summit (LWTS) and my heart jumped for joy! I know, deep down, that I need to be there if coding is going to be a sustainable career for me. I switched jobs and cities to learn to code, but without that lesbian support network I used to have in and out of the workplace I was starting to get really worn down. Not only is the LWTS an amazing opportunity to start creating that network, but the women who are presenting are phenomenal role models to look up to as I begin traversing this career path.</p>

<p>Of course, the challenge then became about logistics. How do I get there? What is a conference really like? How do I pay for it?</p>

<p>Luckily I had recently attending the Women in Tech event "Show me the money!" where I got to sit in on a roundtable discussion with Forest Gibson, crowdfunding extraordinaire, and get great insight into building a successful campaign. With the encouragement of our fantastic program manager Elise, I started setting up an Indiegogo campaign that night. From Gibson's discussion I knew two major keys to my success: 1. Perks can be your downfall- in terms of money, time, and effort as well as 2. Most successful campaigns raise nearly half the money within the first 24 hours.</p>

<p> With this information in hand, I made sure to make my perks small and managable. I know that no one really wants another tshirt or set of cheap stickers from something they funded that isn't very cool. Aside from pre-orders, people generally aren't buying products from campaigns so I made sure to keep my pitch as clear as possible: I wanted to do a specific thing with specific goals and a specific budget, and I needed help to do it. Since I have experience with copywriting, I tried to apply those lessons to my campaign as well. The text had to be positive, clear, and concise. I didn't want anyone to read it as me trying to guilt them into giving me money. In addition, I made sure to thank LWT for giving me a scholarship ticket and clarify that any additional or leftover funds would be going back into the organization. </p>

<p> Well, within the first 24 hours I was at that halfway mark. I shared the campaign on twitter, facebook, and to my immediate family through email. Honestly, I was too busy with a project to really promote it much online, but lo-and-behold, it got shared quite a bit more than I expected. The lesbians in tech network that I am so desperate to connect with were some of the first to really put it out there and promo me hard on social media, leading to my first big donations. My Ada peers shared with their networks on twitter and facebook, which resulted in surprising contributions (like a TA's mom!). What I wasn't expecting was the little bit of push back I did recieve. I had to clarify that no, the LWTS is not an orgy and no, I don't need to go to San Francisco "just to get laid" (and of course I had to flip that back on 'em and start talking about my Big Gay Weekend). Some expressed frustration that I was going to a "specialty interest conference", as if there is no professional or techincal value behind it. </p>

<p>When I first started the campaign, I thought, "Okay, Elise suggested I do this, it's probably supposed to be of value as a life lesson too, but I think I get it  moral of the story so do I really have to do it?". Then again, I really need the financial backing to justify the trip, so I figured with the flex-funding option on Indiegogo, even if all I raised was the $75 to cover the cost of entry to the summit, I would be in a better place than I was. It's been 4 days and I have over 90% of my goal! I am in the home stretch with less than $100 left to raise over the next 7 days. Honestly, I never expected to get this far and despite all the daily microaggressions and homophobia I've experienced as a new female developer, the best part about this campaign is the feeling I have of renewed faith in the community. The generous community members that have contributed have shown me that they aren't just giving diversity lipservice, but that they are willing to back it up (with their wallets)! <3 </p>
