<h2>week 6</h2>

<p>We finally have gotten to Rails! We did railsbridge the second day of class, but now we are at a point where we can really inspect all the different moving parts of rails and starting building things of our own design, rather than a code-along. Our pair programming exercise this week was to create an app that has recipes, ingredients, cookbooks and more. It’s exciting to be able to build something with so many relationships and layers! </p>

<p>My partner was Melinda was a wonderful and friendly partner. At the start of this pair project, I decided that it might be a good strategy to spend a few minutes getting to know her a bit better since we hadn’t worked together before. Last time, my partner and I jumped right in to programming which I think made it more difficult to communicate, however this time after chatting and becoming more familiar with one another, it felt more natural to ease into working together. Occasionally I felt like I was creepin’ on her personal space so I could get closer to hear because she is so quiet, but it was worth it since she was very insightful.</p>

<p>I also had a lot of feels this week about the “community” that we are becoming part of… this is due to not only the incredibly awkward and horrible seattle.rb meetup incident (comic “writeup” on that in the works), but also because of some tweets going around, reblogged by developers and companies, that felt very alienating to me as a woman. A company can say they care about diversity all they want, but it doesn’t make it true. Having experienced sexual harassment & discrimination at past jobs that also were supposedly inclusive, I’m not really so inclined to give everyone the benefit of the doubt when their actions don’t align with the values they say they have. I suppose that the truth of the matter is that I will likely have some mild “culture shock” at any company anyhow, and after 4 years as an expat and also working in extremely male-dominated fields, it’ll be something I can handle.</p>

<p>I’ve also been struggling to find a good code/life balance lately. It’s been hard to find time to do my other hobbies, which is starting to become an issue. I haven’t touched the quilt I’m sewing for my bff for xmas in nearly two months, and other than the mini comics I’m doing for Ada event write-ups I haven’t felt enough energy to draw. I also joined a book club that meets next weekend and haven’t cracked the book yet. Plus I ran out of beer ice cream over a month ago and I haven’t had time to make another batch! (and that’s basically torture, let’s be honest).</p>
