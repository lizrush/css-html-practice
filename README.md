This project was developed during a week focused around html and css. We were tasked with building a simple sinatra app with a "cute pictures of animals" page as well as a blog feature. The focus was to practice implementing different css properties and using html, not necessarily to design a nice UI so you can the fun I had creating this at [liz-sinatra.herokuapp.com](http://liz-sinatra.herokuapp.com).
